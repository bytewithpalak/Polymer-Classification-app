# 🧪 Polymer Classification Web App

This is a Streamlit-based web app that predicts the **type of polymer** based on its physical and chemical properties using a machine learning model.

---

## 📌 About the Project

This app is a part of a machine learning project that involved training multiple classifiers like **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, **SVM**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.  
The app uses one of these trained models to perform real-time predictions on user-provided polymer data.

## 📄 Required Dataset

To use the app, you’ll need a CSV file that contains polymer data.

🔗 **Download the dataset from Kaggle**:  
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsabanzagil/polymers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsabanzagil/polymers)



Extra columns like `label`, `smiles`, or `Unnamed: 0` are ignored automatically.
